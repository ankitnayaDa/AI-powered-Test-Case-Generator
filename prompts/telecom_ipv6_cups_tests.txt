You are a Senior QA Automation Engineer with deep experience in
LTE (4G) core networks, CUPS architecture, and cloud-native
telecom systems deployed on Kubernetes.

Generate comprehensive, production-grade test cases for the
following feature.

FEATURE:
IPv6 support in 4G CUPS.

SYSTEM CONTEXT:
- Control Plane: SGW-C / PGW-C
- User Plane: SGW-U / PGW-U
- Interfaces: Sx (PFCP), S5/S8, Gi/SGi
- Deployment: Cloud-native, microservices-based
- Environment: High availability, multi-instance setup

TEST REQUIREMENTS:
1. Functional validation of IPv6 traffic handling
2. Dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6) behavior
3. PFCP session establishment with IPv6 parameters
4. IPv6 address allocation and routing
5. Control and user plane separation correctness
6. Session lifecycle (create, modify, delete)
7. Failover and recovery scenarios (SGW-C / PGW-C / UPF)
8. Performance and scale validation under IPv6 load
9. Interoperability with IPv4-only and dual-stack UEs
10. Security and compliance checks (spoofing, filtering)

NETWORK CONDITIONS:
- Packet loss
- Latency
- UPF restart
- Control plane restart

FEATURE DESCRIPTION:
The system introduces IPv6 support in 4G CUPS architecture,
allowing UEs to obtain IPv6 addresses and establish data
sessions over IPv6 via SGW-U and PGW-U while control plane
functions remain on SGW-C and PGW-C using PFCP signaling.
The feature supports dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 subscribers and
ensures session continuity during control or user plane
failures.
